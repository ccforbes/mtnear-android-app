#### Project Description
Our app aims to provide easy access to hiking and climbing data through the medium of personal cellular devices. By including climbing data on top of hiking data, we hope for our app to represent a more encompassing outdoors app that can be expanded to other activities ie. mountain biking or skiing. Through the application, users can search for trails/routes that are specific to their experience level and location preference. Additionally, they can browse for results in either a map or list view.
